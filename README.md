# Image search by text with CLIP

A simple example that demonstrate how to find images by text description.

Simple application wth UI:

Jupyter notebook with source code:

By default `environment.yaml` has requirements for the Pytorch with CPU only support.

You can modify `environment.yaml` with `requirements.gpu.txt` instead ``requirements.cpu.txt`.
